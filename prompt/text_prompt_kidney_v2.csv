"This is an image of papillary renal cell carcinoma at high resolution with visually descriptive characteristics of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, complex architectural features, nuclei arranged in layers, nuclear pseudoinclusions, psammoma bodies, heterogeneous cytoplasm, and inflammatory infiltrates."
"This is an image of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma at high resolution with visually descriptive characteristics of halo around nuclei, perinuclear vacuolization, multiple nucleoli, binucleation or multinucleation, finely granular chromatin, and mitotic figures rare or absent."
"This is an image of renal corpuscles which typically have a spherical structure composed of capillary tufts. The capillary walls display orderly arranged cells, forming a regular mesh-like pattern."
"This is an image of proximal and distal convoluted tubules which exhibit elongated tubular structures. The tubular lumens may contain urine, appearing transparent or slightly reddish. Normal tubular cells are cuboidal or columnar, with large, round nuclei."
"This is an image of renal arteries and veins which appear as smaller, branching blood vessels. The vascular walls should exhibit a normal three-layer structure, comprising intima, media, and adventitia."
"This is an image of interstitial tissue which contains connective tissue, blood vessels, and sparse cells. The structure is relatively loose, arranged in a mesh-like pattern, providing support and connection to other structures."
"This is an image of collecting tubules which present as elongated ducts, connected to the renal tubules. The arrangement and structure of these ducts should be orderly under normal conditions."
"This is an image of the cortex which appears as a relatively shallow region containing the majority of renal units, while the medulla, located in the deep cortex, includes collecting ducts and renal pyramids, contributing to urine concentration."
"This is an image of tpithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue appears as a layer of cells tightly packed together, forming sheets or tubes. Epithelial tissue often exhibits distinct cellular borders and may have specialized structures like cilia or microvilli."
"This is an image of connective tissue. Connective tissue displays a variety of visual features depending on the type. Loose connective tissue appears as a meshwork of cells and fibers with spaces in between. Dense connective tissue has densely packed collagen fibers."
"This is an image of muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle tissue appears striated, with long, cylindrical fibers arranged parallel to each other. Cardiac muscle tissue also exhibits striations but has branching fibers interconnected by intercalated discs. Smooth muscle tissue appears non-striated and consists of spindle-shaped cells arranged in sheets or bundles."
"This is an image of nervous tissue. Nervous tissue consists of neurons and supporting cells. Neurons have a cell body with extensions called dendrites and an elongated axon. Nervous tissue may show clusters of cell bodies called ganglia and bundles of nerve fibers. Glial cells are smaller and have various shapes, providing support and insulation to neurons." 
"This is an image of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue appears as clusters or lobules of fat cells, varying in size and shape. The cells are filled with lipid droplets, giving them a clear or foamy appearance. The nucleus of each adipocyte is often displaced to the periphery." 
"This is an image of cartilage. Cartilage appears as a firm and flexible tissue. It consists of chondrocytes embedded in spaces called lacunae within a matrix. The matrix may appear homogeneous or have a fibrous or elastic appearance." 
"This is an image of bone tissue. Bone tissue appears as a solid and calcified structure. In histological sections, bone tissue exhibits concentric rings called lamellae surrounding central canals (Haversian canals). Lacunae within the lamellae contain bone cells (osteocytes). The matrix appears dense and may have visible collagen fibers."
"This is an image of blood tissue. Blood tissue appears as a fluid containing various types of cells suspended in a clear or slightly pinkish liquid called plasma. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are small and biconcave, while white blood cells (leukocytes) can have different shapes and sizes. Platelets are small cell fragments involved in clotting."
"This is an image of lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid tissue may appear as aggregations of lymphocytes. These structures can be surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. Lymphocytes are small cells with a dark, condensed nucleus and a small rim of cytoplasm."
"This is an image of fibrous tissue. Fibrous tissue appears as densely packed collagen fibers with few cells. The fibers can be arranged in parallel bundles or irregular networks, providing strength and support to structures like tendons and ligaments."
"This is an image of glandular tissue. Glandular tissue may appear as clusters or cords of cells, often with distinct shapes and arrangements. Exocrine glands can have ducts and secretory units, while endocrine glands lack ducts and release hormones directly into the bloodstream."
"This is an image of smooth muscle tissue. Smooth muscle tissue appears as spindle-shaped cells with tapered ends. The cells may be arranged in sheets or bundles, often in a circular or longitudinal orientation. Smooth muscle cells lack striations and exhibit a more uniform appearance compared to other muscle types."
"This is an image of cardiac muscle tissue. Cardiac muscle tissue appears striated, like skeletal muscle, but with branching fibers interconnected by intercalated discs. The cells are cylindrical and often contain a single, centrally located nucleus. The presence of intercalated discs gives a distinct appearance."
"This is an image of skeletal muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle tissue appears striated, with long, cylindrical fibers arranged parallel to each other. The cells are multinucleated and have distinct striations due to the arrangement of contractile proteins."
"This is an image of neural tissue. Neural tissue exhibits a variety of cellular structures. Neurons have a cell body with extensions called dendrites and an elongated axon. Glial cells have various shapes and can appear as small cells with nuclei dispersed throughout the tissue."
